# **NopeNet**Â 

## Network Intrusion Detection System

Most cybersecurity tools are too complicated and can't keep up with modern attacks. People often donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s going on or what to do when a threat happens. NopeNet fixes this with a simple and clear dashboard, and an AI assistant that explains things in plain language. It uses machine learning to catch new threats and reaches over 99% average accuracy.

## Features

- **Attack Classification**: Identify and categorize different types of network attacks
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize network traffic and detected threats
- **Test using real attacks**: Generate and test with randomized sampled network traffic attacks
- **Security Recommendations**: Receive detailed security recommendations based on scan results
- **NopeNet AI Chat Assistant**: Engage with our intelligent chat interface that understands your network context, answers security questions, and helps investigate potential threats in real-time
- **Results Visualization**: View detailed analysis results and visualizations
- **NopeNet Resources Page:** Explore different types of network attacks from the KDD dataset and learn about intrusion detection techniques.
- **Articles & Research:** Provides academic papers used to build this project.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **shadcn/ui**
- **Lucide React**

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **Python** (v3.8 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **OpenAI API** (optional for basic detection, required for the chat feature)

## Installation

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal on macOS/Linux).
   Make sure you have Git installed. If not, install it from [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).

2. Clone the NopeNet repository from GitHub using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CodeByGirum/NopeNet-Network-Intrusion-Detection
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Install backend dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r server/requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Get your OpenAI API key** (needed for the chat assistant to work):\
   Go to: [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

6. **Create a ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************`.env.local`**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** file in the project folder** (in the root, next to `package.json`) and add this line:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

   Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual OpenAI API key.\
   You must do this before running the app or the chat assistant will not work.

7. Run the app:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

8. Go to your browser and paste:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```



### ðŸŽ‰ **You're all set!**

---

# *Optional (To start components separately)*

Start the frontend:

```
npm run start:app
```

Open another terminal and start the backend:

```
npm run start:server
```

The application will be available at:

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: API status check
- `POST /predict`: Submit network traffic data for analysis
- `POST /validate`: Validate KDD format of input data
- `GET /sample`: Retrieve a sample of network traffic data generated from a large collection of previously gathered real network attack packets.

## Input Data Format

NopeNet processes network traffic data formatted according to the [KDD Cup 1999](https://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup/view/kdd-cup-1999/Tasks) standard, which includes 41 features for each network packet. Example format:

```
0,tcp,http,SF,215,45076,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.00,0.00,0.00,0,0,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,normal
```

## Model

The system uses an XGBoost classifier trained on the [KDD Cup 1999 dataset](https://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup/view/kdd-cup-1999/Tasks) to detect and classify network attacks into categories:

- Normal traffic
- DOS (Denial of Service)
- Probe (Surveillance/scanning)
- R2L (Unauthorized access from remote machine)
- U2R (Unauthorized access to root privileges)

## Future Improvements

- Integration with real-time network monitoring tools
- Continuous model retraining with new attack patterns
- Ensemble methods for higher accuracy
- Anomaly detection for zero-day attack identification
- Expanded visualization options for security analysts
